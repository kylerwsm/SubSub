Living in the ever-globalising world, it has become a norm and necessity for us to be able to communicate across culture and language barriers. As local university students in Singapore, we are exposed to our globalised teaching community and peers. You see, even in the same language, accents alone can pose a challenging problem in our ability to absorb information verbally. This will be especially true for our peers who are exchange students. We want to alleviate this problem using technology, and that formed the foundation of SubSub.

Here at SubSub, we believe in an inclusive society. The advancement and introduction of technology should never change that. We aim to improve ways people can consume media by leveraging on existing technologies. Specifically, to do this, we are looking into revolutionalising the usage of off-the-shelf speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and translation technologies.
